docs: comprehensive documentation improvements for starter template

- Created docs/README.md as central navigation hub
- Streamlined root README.md from 351 to 186 lines
- Added docs/PATTERNS.md with copy-paste code examples
- Added docs/TESTING.md with comprehensive testing guide
- Added docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md for template adaptation
- Fixed command inconsistencies in DEVELOPMENT.md
- Enhanced GETTING_STARTED.md with "After Setup" section
- Simplified OBSERVABILITY.md for starter template context
- Updated CLAUDE.md with project customization guidance

Documentation now properly focuses on this being a starter template rather than an end application.
