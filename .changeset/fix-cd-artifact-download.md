fix: add run-id and github-token to cross-workflow artifact downloads

The CD workflow needs to download artifacts from the CI workflow run.
The `download-artifact@v4` action requires `run-id` and `github-token`
parameters when downloading artifacts from a different workflow run.

Uses CHANGESETS_PAT for authentication to ensure proper access to artifacts
from the triggering workflow.

This fix ensures the CD workflow can successfully retrieve build artifacts
and SBOMs generated by the CI workflow.
