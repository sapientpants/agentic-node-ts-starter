# 13. Claude Code Development Environment

Date: 2025-08-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project needed to establish standards for AI-assisted development to:

- Accelerate development velocity while maintaining code quality
- Provide consistent patterns for AI-assisted workflows
- Protect against accidental harmful operations
- Document project-specific conventions for AI assistants
- Enable complex automated workflows
- Maintain security and safety guardrails

Key considerations:

- Integration with existing development workflow
- Safety mechanisms to prevent destructive operations
- Clear documentation of project conventions
- Reusable automation patterns
- Balance between automation and developer control

## Decision

We standardized on **Claude Code** (claude.ai/code) as the primary AI-assisted development environment with:

1. **Configuration Documentation**: CLAUDE.md as the single source of truth
2. **Custom Commands**: Reusable workflows in `.claude/commands/`
3. **Safety Hooks**: Protection mechanisms in `.claude/hooks/`
4. **Integration Patterns**: Established patterns for AI-assisted development

### Implementation Details

- **CLAUDE.md Configuration**:
  - Project-specific instructions and conventions
  - Development commands and workflows
  - Architecture patterns and best practices
  - Coding standards and guidelines
  - Common troubleshooting procedures

- **Custom Commands** (`.claude/commands/`):
  - `/spec-feature`: Create feature specifications as GitHub issues
  - `/implement-github-issue`: Full implementation workflow for issues
  - `/update-dependencies`: Automated dependency updates with PR
  - `/fix-sonarqube-issues`: Automated code quality remediation

- **Safety Hooks** (`.claude/hooks/`):
  - `block-git-no-verify.ts`: Prevents bypassing of git hooks
  - Protection against destructive operations
  - Validation of automated changes
  - User confirmation for critical operations

- **Workflow Patterns**:
  - Issue-driven development with specifications
  - Automated PR creation with proper descriptions
  - Test-driven implementation approach
  - Comprehensive validation before commits
  - Changeset management for releases

- **Integration Points**:
  - GitHub CLI for repository operations
  - Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool integration
  - SonarQube API for quality management
  - CI/CD pipeline for validation

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Velocity**: Significant acceleration of routine development tasks
- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns reduce variance in implementation
- **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md serves as living documentation
- **Safety**: Hooks prevent accidental harmful operations
- **Learning**: AI assistance helps developers learn new patterns
- **Automation**: Complex multi-step workflows become single commands
- **Quality**: Automated checks ensure standards are maintained

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand AI collaboration patterns
- **Over-reliance**: Risk of reduced understanding of underlying systems
- **Context Limitations**: AI may miss project-specific nuances
- **Debugging Complexity**: AI-generated code may be harder to debug
- **Tool Dependency**: Reliance on external AI service

### Mitigation

- **Education**: Clear documentation of AI collaboration best practices
- **Review Process**: Human review required for all AI-generated changes
- **Safety Nets**: Multiple validation layers before code reaches production
- **Incremental Adoption**: Start with simple tasks, gradually increase complexity
- **Fallback Procedures**: Clear manual processes for when AI is unavailable
- **Understanding**: Encourage developers to understand generated code
