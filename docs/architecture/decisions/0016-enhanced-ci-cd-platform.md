Date: 2025-08-30

## Status

Accepted

Extends: [ADR-0008](./0008-ci-cd-platform-github-actions.md)

## Context

ADR-0008 established GitHub Actions as our CI/CD platform with solid workflows for validation, releases, and security scanning. As the project matured, we identified opportunities to enhance the platform:

- **Quality Analysis**: Need for continuous code quality monitoring beyond local linting
- **Extended Validation**: Configuration files and documentation needed validation
- **Automated Remediation**: Manual fixing of issues was time-consuming
- **Developer Productivity**: Repetitive tasks could be automated

The original platform provided the foundation, but additional integrations were needed to support a more comprehensive development workflow.

## Decision

We enhanced the CI/CD platform with additional integrations while maintaining the core GitHub Actions infrastructure:

1. **SonarCloud Integration**:
   - Automatic analysis on every pull request
   - Quality gates preventing low-quality merges
   - Pull request decoration with inline feedback
   - SARIF integration with GitHub Security tab

2. **Extended Validation Pipeline**:
   - Markdown linting for all documentation
   - YAML validation for configuration files
   - JSON linting for data files
   - GitHub Actions workflow validation with actionlint

3. **Automated Workflows**:
   - Claude Code commands for automated remediation
   - Dependency update automation
   - Feature implementation from GitHub issues
   - SonarQube issue auto-fixing

### Implementation Details

Building on the original workflows:

- **Parallel Execution**: All validators run concurrently
- **Fast Feedback**: Results posted directly to PRs
- **Quality Gates**: Multiple checkpoints before merge
- **Automation Commands**: Integrated with development workflow

## Consequences

### Positive

All benefits from ADR-0008, plus:

- **Higher Code Quality**: Continuous monitoring catches more issues
- **Faster Development**: Automated fixes reduce manual work
- **Better Visibility**: Quality metrics visible in PRs
- **Comprehensive Validation**: All file types checked
- **Reduced Review Time**: Automated checks catch issues early

### Negative

All challenges from ADR-0008, plus:

- **Additional Services**: Dependency on SonarCloud
- **Complex Workflows**: More steps in CI/CD pipeline
- **Longer Build Times**: Additional 2-3 minutes for analysis
- **Configuration Overhead**: More tools to configure

### Mitigation

Extends mitigations from ADR-0008:

- **Parallel Processing**: Minimize time impact
- **Clear Documentation**: Explain all validations
- **Graceful Failures**: Non-blocking for non-critical checks
- **Local Validation**: Same checks available locally
