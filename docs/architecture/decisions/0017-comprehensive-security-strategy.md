# 17. Comprehensive Security Strategy

Date: 2025-08-30

## Status

Accepted

Extends: [ADR-0009](./0009-container-and-security-scanning-strategy.md)

## Context

ADR-0009 established a strong security foundation with CodeQL, OSV Scanner, Trivy, and SLSA attestations. As security threats evolved and our understanding deepened, we identified additional layers needed:

- **Code Quality Security**: Many security issues stem from code quality problems
- **Security Hotspots**: Code patterns that may not be vulnerabilities but need review
- **Automated Remediation**: Manual fixing of security issues was slow
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Need for defense in depth across all layers

The original strategy was solid but could be enhanced with additional analysis and automation capabilities.

## Decision

We extended the security strategy to create a comprehensive, multi-layered approach:

1. **Enhanced Static Analysis**:
   - SonarCloud security rules complementing CodeQL
   - Security hotspot detection for sensitive patterns
   - OWASP Top 10 vulnerability detection
   - CWE classification for all issues

2. **Automated Security Remediation**:
   - Claude commands for fixing security issues
   - Prioritization by severity (BLOCKER, CRITICAL, HIGH)
   - Bulk operations for common vulnerabilities
   - Integration with PR workflow

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
   - **Source Code**: CodeQL + SonarQube analysis
   - **Dependencies**: OSV Scanner for known CVEs
   - **Containers**: Trivy for image scanning
   - **Code Quality**: Security-related code smells
   - **Supply Chain**: SLSA attestations and SBOM

### Implementation Details

Building on the original security infrastructure:

- **Unified Reporting**: All tools report via SARIF
- **GitHub Security Tab**: Centralized vulnerability view
- **Quality Gates**: Security checks block insecure code
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular scans of existing code

## Consequences

### Positive

All benefits from ADR-0009, plus:

- **Deeper Analysis**: More vulnerabilities detected
- **Faster Remediation**: Automated fixing capabilities
- **Better Prioritization**: Clear severity classifications
- **Proactive Security**: Issues caught earlier
- **Security Education**: Clear explanations help learning

### Negative

All challenges from ADR-0009, plus:

- **Tool Overlap**: Some redundancy between scanners
- **Alert Fatigue**: More findings to triage
- **Complexity**: Multiple security tools to manage
- **False Positives**: Increased volume of findings

### Mitigation

Extends mitigations from ADR-0009:

- **Smart Prioritization**: Focus on high-severity issues
- **Automated Triage**: Claude commands for bulk operations
- **Clear Thresholds**: Configurable severity levels
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodic assessment of tool effectiveness
