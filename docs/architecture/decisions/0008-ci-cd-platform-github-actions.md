# 8. CI/CD Platform: GitHub Actions

Date: 2025-08-28

## Status

Extended by [ADR-0016](./0016-enhanced-ci-cd-platform.md)

## Context

The project required a robust CI/CD platform that would:

- Integrate seamlessly with GitHub repository hosting
- Support complex workflows with parallel execution
- Provide comprehensive security scanning and validation
- Enable automated releases and multi-channel publishing
- Offer cost-effective pricing for open-source projects
- Support modern development practices (monorepos, matrix builds)

Key options considered:

- **GitHub Actions**: Native GitHub integration, powerful workflow system
- **CircleCI**: Strong performance, flexible configuration
- **Jenkins**: Self-hosted, maximum control but high maintenance
- **GitLab CI**: Excellent features but would require GitLab migration
- **Azure DevOps**: Enterprise features but complex setup

## Decision

We chose **GitHub Actions** as our CI/CD platform because:

1. **Native Integration**: Seamless GitHub repository integration
2. **Workflow Flexibility**: Complex parallel workflows with dependencies
3. **Security Features**: Built-in security scanning and SARIF integration
4. **Marketplace**: Extensive action marketplace for common tasks
5. **Cost Effectiveness**: Free for public repositories, reasonable pricing for private

### Implementation Details

- **Workflow Structure**:
  - `pr.yml`: Pull request validation with parallel checks
  - `main.yml`: Release pipeline with comprehensive automation
  - `publish.yml`: Multi-channel distribution (npm, Docker, GitHub Packages)
  - Reusable workflows for common patterns

- **Security Integration**:
  - CodeQL for static analysis
  - OSV Scanner for dependency vulnerabilities
  - Container scanning with Trivy
  - SARIF report integration with Security tab

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Parallel job execution
  - Strategic caching (pnpm, Docker layers)
  - Conditional execution based on change detection
  - Matrix builds for multi-environment support

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Developer Experience**: Integrated with GitHub workflow, familiar interface
- **Security**: Built-in security features and scanning integration
- **Performance**: Fast execution with excellent caching support
- **Flexibility**: Complex workflows with conditional logic and dependencies
- **Cost**: Free for open-source, competitive pricing for private repos
- **Ecosystem**: Extensive marketplace of pre-built actions
- **Maintenance**: Minimal infrastructure maintenance required

### Negative

- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tightly coupled to GitHub platform
- **Complexity**: Complex workflows can become difficult to debug
- **Resource Limits**: Execution time and resource constraints
- **Learning Curve**: YAML workflow syntax and GitHub-specific features

### Mitigation

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation in workflow files
- **Modularity**: Reusable workflows reduce duplication and complexity
- **Testing**: Local testing with `act` tool for workflow validation
- **Monitoring**: Workflow status monitoring and failure notifications
- **Fallback**: Workflows designed to gracefully handle failures
